# Process Scheduling Simulation(FCFS & SJF)

This program simulates two CPU scheduling algorithms:
- First Come First Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)


## How to Compile
```bash
gcc assignment1.c -o scheduler
./scheduler
```

## Then Enter:

Enter the number of processes: 4                               
Enter the arrival time and burst time for process 1: 0 8       
Enter the arrival time and burst time for process 2: 1 4
Enter the arrival time and burst time for process 3: 2 9
Enter the arrival time and burst time for process 4: 3 5
